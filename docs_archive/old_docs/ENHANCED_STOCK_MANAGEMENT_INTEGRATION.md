# Enhanced Stock Management System - Integration Guide

## Overview
The enhanced stock management system has been successfully integrated into the fertilizer inventory management application, providing enterprise-level inventory control with batch tracking, FEFO (First Expired, First Out) logic, and automated reorder management.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Database Enhancements
- **Enhanced stock management schema** with batch tracking, reservations, and reorder alerts
- **Advanced stock functions** with FEFO logic, reservation management, and automated triggers
- **Scheduled job system** for automatic reorder alert generation

### 2. Batch Management System
- **Batch/lot tracking** with expiry date management
- **FEFO allocation** for fertilizer expiry management
- **Reserved stock functionality** for pending orders
- **Negative stock prevention** constraints
- **Multi-level stock management** (min, max, reorder points)

### 3. POS System Integration
- **Automatic batch selection dialog** for products with batch tracking enabled
- **FEFO-based batch allocation** during sales
- **Real-time batch availability checking**
- **Expiry status indicators** (good, warning, critical, expired)
- **Manual batch selection override** capability

### 4. Purchase Form Integration
- **Automatic batch creation** from purchase orders
- **Batch number and expiry date fields** in purchase items
- **Integration with enhanced stock functions** for automatic stock updates
- **Supplier linkage** for batch traceability

### 5. Frontend Components
- **BatchManagementPage.tsx** - Complete batch inventory management
- **ReorderAlertsPage.tsx** - Alert monitoring and acknowledgment system
- **BatchSelectionDialog.tsx** - POS batch selection interface
- **Enhanced ProductForm.tsx** - All new stock management fields

## Database Schema Changes

### New Tables
1. **product_batches** - Batch tracking with expiry dates
2. **reorder_alerts** - Automated reorder notifications
3. **stock_reservations** - Reserved stock for pending orders

### Enhanced Tables
- **products** - Added batch tracking flags and stock level fields
- **stock_movements** - Enhanced audit trail with batch references

### New Functions
- **allocate_stock_fefo()** - FEFO allocation logic
- **reserve_stock()** - Stock reservation management
- **release_reservation()** - Reservation cleanup
- **generate_reorder_alerts()** - Automated alert generation

## Integration Points

### POS System Workflow
1. User adds product to cart
2. System checks if product has batch tracking enabled
3. If enabled, opens BatchSelectionDialog
4. Dialog shows available batches sorted by expiry date (FEFO)
5. User selects batches or accepts auto-allocation
6. Cart updated with batch selections
7. Sale completion allocates from selected batches

### Purchase Order Workflow
1. User creates purchase order with batch information
2. System creates purchase items with batch numbers and expiry dates
3. On purchase completion, system creates product_batches records
4. Stock levels automatically updated via triggers
5. Batch tracking becomes available for POS selection

### Stock Management Workflow
1. Real-time stock updates via database triggers
2. Automatic FEFO allocation during sales
3. Reserved stock prevents overselling
4. Reorder alerts generated based on stock levels
5. Batch expiry monitoring with status indicators

## Configuration

### Enable Batch Tracking for Products
```sql
UPDATE products 
SET batch_tracking_enabled = true 
WHERE category_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM categories 
  WHERE name LIKE '%Fertilizer%'
);
```

### Set Stock Level Thresholds
```sql
UPDATE products 
SET 
  minimum_stock_level = 100,
  reorder_point = 200,
  maximum_stock_level = 1000
WHERE batch_tracking_enabled = true;
```

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. POS Batch Selection Test
- Create product with batch tracking enabled
- Add multiple batches with different expiry dates
- Add product to POS cart
- Verify batch selection dialog appears
- Test FEFO auto-allocation
- Complete sale and verify stock deduction

### 2. Purchase Order Batch Creation Test
- Create purchase order with batch information
- Include batch numbers and expiry dates
- Complete purchase
- Verify product_batches records created
- Check stock levels updated correctly

### 3. Reorder Alert Test
- Set product minimum stock levels
- Reduce stock below threshold
- Wait for scheduled job execution
- Verify reorder alerts generated
- Test alert acknowledgment

## API Endpoints

### Batch Management
- `GET /api/batches/:productId` - Get product batches
- `POST /api/batches/allocate` - Allocate stock using FEFO
- `PUT /api/batches/:id` - Update batch information

### Stock Reservations
- `POST /api/stock/reserve` - Reserve stock for order
- `DELETE /api/stock/reserve/:id` - Release reservation

### Reorder Alerts
- `GET /api/alerts/reorder` - Get pending reorder alerts
- `PUT /api/alerts/:id/acknowledge` - Acknowledge alert

## Security Considerations

### Row Level Security (RLS)
All new tables implement RLS policies ensuring:
- Merchants can only access their own data
- Proper user authentication required
- Audit trail maintained for all operations

### Data Validation
- Batch numbers must be unique per product per merchant
- Expiry dates validated against manufacturing dates
- Stock quantities cannot go negative
- Reserved stock cannot exceed available stock

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Indexes
```sql
-- Batch lookup optimization
CREATE INDEX idx_product_batches_product_expiry 
ON product_batches(product_id, expiry_date);

-- Stock movement queries
CREATE INDEX idx_stock_movements_product_date 
ON stock_movements(product_id, created_at);

-- Reorder alert queries
CREATE INDEX idx_reorder_alerts_merchant_status 
ON reorder_alerts(merchant_id, status);
```

### Caching Strategy
- Product batch information cached in frontend
- Stock levels updated real-time via triggers
- Reorder alerts cached with 5-minute TTL

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Batch expiry rates and waste reduction
- Stock turnover improvements
- Reorder alert accuracy
- System performance impact

### Maintenance Tasks
- Regular cleanup of expired batches
- Archive old stock movements
- Monitor and tune database performance
- Update stock level thresholds seasonally

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Batch selection not appearing**: Check batch_tracking_enabled flag
2. **FEFO not working**: Verify expiry dates are properly set
3. **Stock discrepancies**: Check trigger execution and audit trail
4. **Performance issues**: Review database indexes and query plans

### Debug Queries
```sql
-- Check batch allocation
SELECT * FROM allocate_stock_fefo('product_id', 'merchant_id', quantity);

-- Verify stock movements
SELECT * FROM stock_movements 
WHERE product_id = 'product_id' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check reorder alerts
SELECT * FROM reorder_alerts 
WHERE merchant_id = 'merchant_id' 
AND status = 'pending';
```
